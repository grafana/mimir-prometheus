      Placeholders replaced by Prometheus during serving:
      - GLOBAL_CONSOLES_LINK is replaced and set to the consoles link if it exists.
        It will render a "Consoles" link in the navbar when it is non-empty.
      - PROMETHEUS_AGENT_MODE is replaced by a boolean indicating if Prometheus is running in agent mode.
        It true, it will disable querying capacities in the UI and generally adapt the UI to the agent mode.
        It has to be represented as a string, because booleans can be mangled to !1 in production builds.
      - PROMETHEUS_READY is replaced by a boolean indicating whether Prometheus was ready at the time the
        web app was served. It has to be represented as a string, because booleans can be mangled to !1 in
        production builds.

        The TITLE_PLACEHOLDER magic value is replaced during serving by Prometheus.
        We need it dynamic because it can be overridden by the command line flag `web.page-title`.
